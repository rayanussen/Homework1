## My Hobbies

Here are a few of my favorite hobbies:
1. **Watching and playing sports**: From football to basketball, I enjoy both being on the field and cheering from the sidelines or at the TV.
2. **Having fun with my friends**: Spending time with friends is something I value.
3. **Playing video games**: Gaming helps me relax and unwind after a busy day.

## Why Am I Studying Economics?

Economics fascinates me because it’s about understanding human behavior, decision-making, and how markets shape the world.  
The IB Economics course introduced me to these ideas, and now, at IE University, I am diving deeper into these concepts.

## Note

I’m also learning how to code in Python and exploring tools like **PyCharm** and **GitHub**.  
Combining tech with Economics is exciting but still very hard for me!
